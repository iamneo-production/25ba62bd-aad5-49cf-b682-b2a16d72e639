  <h2>  How to Calculate Income Tax on Salary with example</h2>
  <br/><p>By many, income tax is looked at as a necessary evil. With ever-changing tax laws and several jargons – tax exemption, tax rebate, tax deduction, tax saving, etc –<br/> to decipher, most of the time we do not even realize what portion of our income is being taxed, and how we can save some money.</p>

  <h4>How to Calculate Income Tax on Salary? </h4>
  <p>Generally, tax is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate with the taxable income. Though it seems simple, it consists of several steps, including <br/>calculating gross salary, calculating deductions and exemptions, calculating tax payable, deducting tax already paid.</p>
<br/>
  <pre style={{color:"green", fontSize:"20px"}}>To make it simple, here are the 5 steps that you can use to calculate income tax on salary: </pre>

  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>Step 1: Calculate your gross income</p>

  <p>First, write down the annual gross salary you get. This will include all the components of your salary, including House Rent Allowance (HRA), <br/>Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), and special allowances, like food coupons and mobile reimbursements.<br/><br/>For HRA, remember you can claim HRA only if you live in a rented house and can submit valid rent receipts as proof. You can easily fill out and <br/>download the rent receipt from the ET Money website and submit it after affixing the revenue stamp and getting it signed by your landlord or landlady to<br/> claim the HRA benefit. If you have your own accommodation or live with your parents, then HRA is fully taxable.</p><br/>

  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>Step 2 – Arrive at your net taxable income by removing deductions</p>

  <p>Tax deductions allow you to reduce your taxable income further by investing, saving, or spending on certain items.

First is the Standard Deduction <br/>of Rs 50,000 (mentioned in the previous section), which can be availed by all, without making investments or expenditures on any defined products.

Next,<br/> deduct investment and expenses eligible under Section 80.</p><br/>
  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>Step 3: Arriving at your net taxable income</p>
  <p>By subtracting all the eligible deductions from the gross taxable income, you will arrive at your total income on which you need to pay tax basis your tax slab.</p>
  <br/>
  <img src={table} alt="" style={{width:"1000px"}}/><br/>
  <br/><p>This slab rate is different for senior citizens. For those who are over 60 years old with up to Rs 3 lakh net income, the tax rate is nil. And for very senior citizens, <br/>who are over 80 years old, up to Rs 5 lakh net income, the tax rate is nil. Basically, the applicable tax rates depend on your age and net income.</p><br/>
  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>STEP 4 – Calculate Your Taxes</p>
  <br/>
  <p>
  Now, one pays tax on his/her net taxable income.
<ul>
  <br/>
<BiSolidRightArrowAlt/>For the first Rs. 2.5 lakh of your taxable income you pay zero tax<br/>
<BiSolidRightArrowAlt/>For the next Rs. 2.5 lakhs you pay 5% i.e. Rs 12,500<br/>
<BiSolidRightArrowAlt/>For the next 5 lakhs you pay 20% i.e. Rs 1,00,000<br/>
<BiSolidRightArrowAlt/>For your taxable income part which exceeds Rs. 10 lakhs you pay 30% on the entire amount
</ul>
  </p>
  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>Step 5: Consolidate your net tax</p>
  <p><b>Rebate under Sec 87A:</b> Tax rebate is a form of tax incentive provided by the government to individuals earning an income below a specified limit. <br/>In case your total taxable income after deductions doesn’t exceed Rs 5 lakh, you can claim rebate under Sec 87A of Rs 12,500.<br/><br/>Now if your taxable incomeis more than Rs 5 lakh, you can add the health and education cess of 4 percent to your tax amount to see the final amount you will pay.<br/><br/>For people in the very high-income bracket, i.e. between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore, they need to pay a surcharge of 10 percent. And,<br/> for income between Rs 1 and Rs 2 crore, surcharge is 20 percent.</p>


  <p style={{color:"darkblue",fontSize:"20px"}}>Step 6: Calculate Tax </p>
  <p>As you can see tax deductions can help you save a lot of tax. And there are some great avenues that can help you not only achieve this but also help reduce stress around finances.</p><br/>
